        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Isai Sotarriva, a physicist and a machine learning expert. I am in process of obtaining my PhD at the Institute of sciences Tokyo (former Tokyo institute of Technollogy) in Japan. I have a strong background in physics and statistics, and I am passionate about machine learning and data science. I have experience in developing machine learning models for various applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. I am proficient in Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
        </p>
        <p>
            On my free time I enjoy playing age of empires, hiking, and listening to music. Sometimes I will also devote some of htat time to learn new programming languages and technologies.

                <h3>aoe2de_editor</h3>
                <p>aoe2de_editor was my first flutter project. It was born out of the frustration I experienced moding with the Genie editor. Instead of being a raw data editor like the Genie editor, aoe2de_editor is a more user-friendly editor showing the data in a way we as players are more familiar with instead of the low level details like the Genie editor does.  The main purpose of this project is to help impleneting new civilization ideas in a much shorter time than it would take with the Genie editor.</p>
                <p>Technologies used: Flutter, Dart</p>

                <h3>macchiato</h3>
                <p>macchiato is my latest project. It is a lprivacy first latex editor focused on making collaborative work like paper writing easier. It is designed to comply with the most strict privacy regulations and to be easy to use. </p>
                <p>The macchiato project uses the power of a local LLM server to provide advance editing and writting features like literature suggestions, paper reviews, and more. </p>
                <p>Technologies used: flutter, dart, python, C++, LLM</p>

                <h3>DH</h3>
                <p> This was a project I did as part of a lecture in university called Digital humanities. On this project I implemented a RAG system on a database with japanese news articles in Japanes and english. The main goal of this project was to create a system that could provide references to the articles it is using to as a source when answering questions. </p>
                <p>Technologies used: Python, pandas, gemma (LLM), text encoders</p>
